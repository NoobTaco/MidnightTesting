## Guild Housing Finds

### Guild Housing Issues
- Once the guild neighborhood is established, you need to log out and back in before you can move your house to that neighborhood.
- Sometimes, when you exit your house, it appears to be missing. As a workaround, simply travel to the neighborhood through the menu and your house will reappear. (Will test some more but seems to be resolved)
## Guild Housing Finds

### Guild Finder Behavior
When searching for neighborhoods, your Guild appears at the top of the finder list, making it easy to locate and join your Guild's housing area.

### Guild Management and Permissions
* Your other toons can visit your guild house without being in the guild. (As of now)
* There are no settings or permissions for GM or Officers to limit plots. It will be a free-for-all.
* Endeavors and any controls to that are not enabled for testing yet.

#### Neighborhood Renaming
The NPC Lyssabel Dawnpetal, followed by the Neighborhood Steward, sells a renaming scroll that allows you to rename your guild neighborhood. This is useful for customizing your guild's housing area name.
