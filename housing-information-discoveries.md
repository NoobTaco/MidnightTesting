### Guild Housing Issues
- Once the guild neighborhood is established, you need to log out and back in before you can move your house to that neighborhood.

## Guild Housing Finds

### Guild Finder Behavior
When searching for neighborhoods, your Guild appears at the top of the finder list, making it easy to locate and join your Guild's housing area.

### Guild Management and Permissions
* All of your characters in your warband can visit your guild house without being in the guild.
* We discovered a permission setting in the guild ranks settings that refers to a guild management page. However, that has not been released yet, so we do not know what can be changed or updated.
* Endeavors and any controls to that are not enabled for testing yet.

#### Neighborhood Renaming
The NPC Lyssabel Dawnpetal, followed by the Neighborhood Steward, sells a renaming scroll that allows you to rename your guild neighborhood. This is useful for customizing your guild's housing area name.
