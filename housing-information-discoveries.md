## Guild Housing Finds

### Guild Housing Issues
- Once the guild neighborhood is established, you need to log out and back in before you can move your house to that neighborhood.
- Sometimes, when you exit your house, it appears to be missing. As a workaround, simply travel to the neighborhood through the menu and your house will reappear. (Will test some more but seems to be resolved)
## Guild Housing Finds

### Guild Finder Behavior
When searching for neighborhoods, your Guild appears at the top of the finder list, making it easy to locate and join your Guild's housing area.

### Guild Management and Permissions
* Your other toons can visit your guild house without being in the guild. (As of now)
* There are no settings or permissions for GM or Officers to limit plots. It will be a free-for-all.
* Endeavors and any controls to that are not enabled for testing yet.

There are great large areas available in the housing system, suitable for hosting large gatherings, social events, or shows.
Seating
* 98 seats for the audience.
* 15 seats in the band pit
The stage is large and the curtains move.
