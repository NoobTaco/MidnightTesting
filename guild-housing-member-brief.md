# Guild Housing — Member Brief (Draft)

This briefing is prepared for guild leadership and members to summarize the current findings and recommended actions for World of Warcraft: Midnight guild housing. It is suitable for distribution at meetings and for inclusion in the Alliance housing thread.

## 1. Purpose

This document informs guild leadership about the housing system, summarizes key discoveries and features, and provides recommendations for managing housing for a large guild (500+ members).

## 2. Neighborhood & Plot Layout

- Each neighborhood contains 55 house plots.
- Alliance and Horde have distinct neighborhood layouts.
- Guilds can establish a guild neighborhood, which provides a central hub for members.

Visual references:

- Horde Layout: ![Horde NH Plots](docs/images/horde-NH-plots.png)

## 3. Guild Housing Mechanics

- After establishing a guild neighborhood, members may need to log out and back in before moving their house into the new neighborhood.
- Your guild appears at the top of the neighborhood finder list, making it easy for members to find and join.

Important notes:

- Members cannot move into a house unless they have pre-purchased the Midnight expansion.
- Housing is scheduled to be enabled during the prepatch (version 11.2.7); estimated release dates may change.

## 4. Permissions & Access Control

Permission settings exist in guild ranks, but the full management page is not yet released.

### Per House permissions
Current permission options (subject to change):
    - **Owner:** Full control
    - **Friends:** Visit/interact, cannot change settings
    - **Guild Members:** Visit/interact, cannot change settings unless explicitly allowed
    - **Public:** Visit only, no changes
Flexible access supports both private and social playstyles.

### 4.1 Player Warband Access

All characters in a player's warband can visit that player's guild house, even if the character is not in the guild. This is a player-specific feature, not a guild-wide permission.

## 5. Customization & Decor

- Houses support customization of floors, walls, and roofs.
- Decor items can be crafted or purchased from vendors (vendors currently show up to three pages of items).

## 6. Gathering & Crafting

- The Lumberjack skill is required to gather lumber for housing items.
- Learn Lumberjack from Lestia Goldenstrike (in town).
- Example quest rewards: Lumberjack skill, coin, and XP.
- An axe is required for lumber gathering.

- Axe: ![Lumberjack Axe](docs/images/lumberjack-quest2.png) ![Lumberjack Axe with Quest Text](docs/images/lumberjack-quest3.png)

## 7. Endeavors

Endeavors will not be required for participation in guild housing. Participation is voluntary, and we expect many members may opt in once the system is live.

## 8. Recommendations for Large Guilds

### 8.1 Neighborhood Layers & Lot Allotment

- Only one main guild neighborhood (NH) exists. If demand exceeds 55 plots, the system creates additional layers (overflow).
- The exact occupancy threshold that triggers a new layer is not confirmed (devs mentioned ~80% in some statements). Leadership should monitor official updates.

Considerations and suggested approach:

1. Assign officers to monitor layer occupancy and member distribution.
2. Encourage members to consolidate into the most active layers to preserve community feel.
3. Create a clear lot-allocation policy (e.g., first-come, officer approval, event-based rewards).
4. Communicate plot availability and benefits of consolidation to members regularly.
5. Use events to encourage movement into active layers.

## 9. Open Questions & To-Do

- Await release of the full guild management page for housing.
- Test permission settings for Friends, Guild Members, and Public when the UI is available.
- Monitor for additional decor, crafting, and event-related features in future updates.

## 10. Call to Action — Member Participation

### 10.1 PTR Participation

If another PTR (Public Test Realm) event is available, we encourage as many members as possible to log in and be invited into the PTR guild. This helps test layering and plot visibility.

### 10.2 Open Beta Participation

- Open Beta requires pre-purchasing the Midnight expansion.
- We will need an initial group to create the guild and establish housing (approx. 5 to create + 5 additional to set up housing). Afterward, invite interested members to the Beta guild for broader testing.

Note on Beta timing: a public beta date is not confirmed. Expect timing to follow alpha testing phases.

## 11. Guild Activity & Retention Policy (Draft)

Effective date: TBD — policy to be applied with the Midnight expansion launch.

### 11.1 Purpose

Keep the Guild Neighborhood active while providing a fair process for members who are inactive for extended periods.

### 11.2 Members with Guild Housing

- Rule: Members who occupy a guild housing plot and are inactive for two (2) months may be removed from the guild roster to free plots for active members. (Details subject to available in-game tools and final design.)
- Your property is not lost — the game moves the home and contents into secure housing storage.
- Returning members can request a guild invite and reclaim their house from storage when a plot is available.

### 11.3 Members without Guild Housing

- Rule: Members without a housing plot may be removed for one (1) year of inactivity.

### 11.4 Returning to the Guild

Removal for inactivity is not punitive. Contact officers or the Guild Master for re-invitation — progress and property are preserved.

## 12. Alliance Housing Thread & Ongoing Discussion

Create a Housing Thread in #Alliance for questions and ongoing updates after the meeting. This report will be updated as new information becomes available.

A: No, only members who have pre-purchased the Midnight expansion can move into a guild house.

**Q: What happens if I am removed for inactivity?**
A: Your house and contents are moved to secure storage. You can reclaim your house when you return and a plot is available.

**Q: How do I get the Lumberjack skill?**
A: Learn Lumberjack from Lestia Goldenstrike in town. You’ll need an axe to gather lumber for housing items.

**Q: Can all my characters visit my guild house?**
A: Yes, all characters in your warband can visit your guild house, even if they are not in the guild.

**Q: What if all 55 plots are full?**
A: The system creates additional layers (overflow neighborhoods) if demand exceeds 55 plots. Leadership will monitor and communicate availability.

**Q: Where can I ask more questions?**
A: Use the #Alliance Housing Thread for ongoing questions and updates.

**Q: What do I do if my Horde and Alliance characters are all in the Alliance neighborhood? Can I still create a Horde house in a Horde neighborhood?**
A: Yes. Any Horde character can create a house in a Horde neighborhood, whether it is a private house or part of a Horde guild neighborhood. If your Horde character is in a Horde guild, they can join the Horde guild neighborhood. The same applies for Alliance characters and neighborhoods. Your characters are not restricted by where your other faction characters have houses; each character can create or join a house in their own faction's neighborhood as long as they meet the requirements.
