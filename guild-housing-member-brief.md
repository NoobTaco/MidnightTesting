# Guild Housing: Member Brief

## What’s New?

- Guilds can establish their own neighborhoods in World of Warcraft: Midnight.
- Each neighborhood has 55 house plots. Overflow is handled by additional layers if needed.
- Both Alliance and Horde have unique layouts.

**Visual References:**

## Getting Started

- To move into a guild neighborhood, you must have pre-purchased the Midnight expansion.
- Housing will be enabled during the prepatch (version 11.2.7), estimated for December 2.
- After the neighborhood is created, log out and back in before moving your house.

## Permissions

- Access is managed by guild ranks:
  - Owners: Full control
  - Friends/Guild Members: Visit/interact (settings may change)
  - Public: Visit only

## What to Expect

- Only one main guild neighborhood exists; overflow is handled by layers.
- Members may be distributed across several layers if demand exceeds 55 plots.

## Call to Action: Guild Member Participation

9. **Guild participation in the next PTR:**
   - If there is another open PTR event, we encourage as many members as possible to log into the PTR and be invited into the guild. This will allow us to test the layering effect and give everyone a chance to view available plots and make a house.

10. **Guild participation in open Beta:**
    - To participate in the open Beta, you must have pre-purchased the Midnight expansion.
    - When the open Beta begins, we will need 5 people to help create the guild and 5 more (for a total of 10) to establish the guild housing. Afterward, all interested members will be invited into the Beta guild for further housing system testing.

## WIP: Guild Activity & Retention Policy

**Effective Date: TBA**

### 1. Purpose

To ensure a vibrant and active community, especially within the new Guild Neighborhood, we are implementing the following activity policy. This policy aims to keep our shared spaces populated by active members while providing a clear and fair process for members who take a break from the game.

### 2. Policy for Members with Guild Housing

This policy will take effect with the launch of the *Midnight* expansion.

- **Rule:** Members who occupy a guild housing plot and have not logged in for **two (2) months** will be removed from the guild roster. (or plot if tools are provided *update this once we know more!)
- **Reason:** This policy is necessary to free up housing plots for other active members, ensuring our Guild Neighborhood remains a lively and engaging community hub.
- **Your Property is Safe:** Your house, items, and progress are **not lost**. The game automatically places your home and its contents into a secure housing storage.
- **How to Return:** You are always welcome back. Upon your return to the game, simply request a guild invite. Once you rejoin, you can go to the Guild Neighborhood, select any available plot, and replace your house from storage.

### 3. Policy for Members Without Guild Housing

This policy is effective immediately.

- **Rule:** Members who do not occupy a guild housing plot will be removed from the guild roster after **one (1) year** of inactivity.
- **Reason:** This is a standard guild management practice to maintain a roster of active, current members.

### 4. Returning to the Guild

We understand that real life comes first. Removal for inactivity is not a punishment, and we are happy to welcome returning members.

If you have been removed under this policy, please contact an Officer or Guild Master for a new invitation. All of your progress and property will be waiting for you.

## Alliance Housing Thread & Ongoing Discussion

After Sunday's meeting, we will start a Housing Thread in #Alliance where members can post any questions not already answered in this Housing Report. Please note that this is an ongoing, evolving project by Blizzard, and there are many questions that cannot be answered at this time. We encourage everyone to participate and stay engaged as new information becomes available.
